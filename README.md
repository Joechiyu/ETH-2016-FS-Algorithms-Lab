# ETH Zurich - Fall 2016 - Algorithms Lab
### Introduction
The objective of this course is to learn how to solve a problem given by a textual description. This includes appropriate problem modeling, choice of suitable (combinatorial) algorithms, and implementing them. This repository includes all exercises descriptions of this course and gives corresponding C++ solutions.
</br></br>
These exercises are in ACM style and mainly use the following libraries: STL, BGL and CGAL. The main algorithms and thoughts include Sliding Window, Sorting, Binary Search, Depth/Breadth First Search, Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Minimum Circle, Connected Component, Minimum Spanning Tree, Shortest Path, Maximum Matching, Split and List, Linear/Quadratic Programming, Delaunay Triangulation and Maximum Flow with/without Minimum Cost.
