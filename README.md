# ETH Zurich - Fall 2016 - Algorithms Lab
The objective of this course is to learn how to solve a problem given by a textual description. This includes appropriate problem modeling, choice of suitable (combinatorial) algorithms, and implementing them.
</br></br>
This repository includes all exercises descriptions and C++ codes solutions of the Algorithms Lab course at ETH Zurich during the semester Fall 2016. These exercises are in ACM style and mainly use the following libraries: STL, BGL and CGAL.
</br></br>
The main algorithms and thoughts include Sliding Window, Sorting, Binary Search, DFS/BFS, Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Minimum Circle, Connected Component, Minimum Spanning Tree, Shortest Path, Maximum Matching, Split and List, Linear/Quadratic Programming, Delaunay Triangulation, Maximum Flow (with Minimum Cost).
